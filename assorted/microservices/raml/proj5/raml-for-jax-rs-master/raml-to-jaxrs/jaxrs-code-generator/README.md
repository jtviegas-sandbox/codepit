## Generation plugins
This feature provides control over the generation process. It's possible to modify class/interface/method generation using RAML 1.0 annotations.

The available annotations are:
```raml
annotationTypes:
    types:
        allowedTargets: TypeDeclaration
        properties:
            className?:
                type: string
            implementationClassName?:
                type: string
            usePrimitiveType?:
                type: boolean
            abstract?:
                type: boolean
    resources:
        allowedTargets: [Resource, API]
        properties:
            onResourceClassCreation?: string
            onResourceClassFinish?: string
    methods:
        allowedTargets: [Method, API]
        properties:
            onResourceMethodCreation?: string
            onResourceMethodFinish?: string
            onResponseClassCreation?: string
            onResponseClassFinish?: string
    responses:
        allowedTargets: [Response, API]
        properties:
            onResponseMethodCreation?: string
            onResponseMethodFinish?: string
```

The `*Creation` methods are executed fairly early in the process. Resource creation, for example, handles the resource creation process
 (the recursion, the finding of the methods and such). This allows you to override the entire process. Should you want to prevent the generation of a class by returning `null`, this is an easy place to do it.

The `*Finish` methods are called just before the build part, when `raml-to-jaxrs` thinks it has finished. This is the one you propably want to override.

All the interception classes are located [here](src/main/java/org/raml/jaxrs/generator/extension/resources).
The classes/interfaces/methods are generated by [JavaPoet](https://github.com/square/javapoet).
Each method should return the `*.Builder` that was passed to it OR
a new one built by the method (except in the `*Creation` plugins, which should be passed a `null` Builder).
It should be noted that if a plugin method returns `null`, the class or method will not be generated.

### Using the generation plugins
An example project showcasing these plugins is documented [here](../examples/maven-examples/features/README.md).

### When to use the generation plugins
There are several use-cases listed and explained [here](../examples/maven-examples/features/USE_CASES.MD).
