## Entities and Identifiers
New entity instances won't have an identifier until such time as they've been posted to the appropriate resource URI.  However, I didn't feel that just making an identifier property optional for entity messages would be an appropriate approach as it left the decision to include an Identifier to the developer.  I recognized that this would yield many HTTP 422 error responses for HTTP posts and puts that I'd end up having to repeatedly explain to developers.  

Hence, I've defined two basic types for every entity that can be posted to the API. A basic entity and a so-called _New_ entity.

For example:  There's a Provider Type which is derived from a NewProvider Type.

The implication is _new_ entity Types __don't have identifiers included in their definition__.  What does that mean?  It means, when one is submitting a new entity such as a new provider by posting the provider message to the _/providers_ URI, the message Type is actually a NewProvider not strictly a Provider.  The difference being theirs no identifier or related links in the message.  Identifiers are only critical where an entity has been successfully persisted to the underlying database.  Operations with persisted entities __require__ identifiers.  For example, to use the patch HTTP verb, it's necessary for any related fields to quote the appropriate identifiers, otherwise the service wouldn't know if the related entities were new instances or existing instances, and even then it would still have to try and search for any existing entities based o the supplied data.  Pretty awful.
#### Update:
I think I need remove identifier properties altogether and actually just require a link to "self".  The link to self would implicitly include the identifier of course, but it might simplify the issue considerably with the potential to be a quite elegant solution.  Not sure how to specify this scheme however, as I don't think the RAML spec. language is quite up to declaring this methodology in a manner that can be automatically validated.  This is actually one of the ideas "inspired" by those self-documenting JSON resource formats that Bala dug up.
#### Update:
I think the __PATCH__ HTTP verb usage implies that data updated with this method only require partial entity values in the message.  For example, if the provider is being termed, maybe the term date is the only property "required" for the entity in the message body.  This would imply the need to have a separate entity definition for patch methods _without_ any "required" attributes. i.e. remove whether fields are mandatory or not.

I've researched it and the general consensus is to actually have a distinct data type definition explicitly defined as having __required: false__ for every message property.  Seems like kind of poor DRY principal usage.  See here http://forums.raml.org/t/raml-1-0-data-types-required-properties-and-get-put-post/2050/2 for a recent discussion on just this problem.
