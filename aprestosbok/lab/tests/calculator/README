Usage

* see run.bat to invoke with maven or...;
* java -jar <calculator-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar location> <expressions file>


Assumptions

* only integer numbers;
* input files are correct, won't implement specific exception handling;

Improvement Suggestions

* implement logging;
* IoC/Dependency injection for the implementation objects, as an example the Calculator
	implementation is coded, should be resolved in runtime context - Spring should do it;
