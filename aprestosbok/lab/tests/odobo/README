Usage

* see run.bat to invoke with maven or ... 
* to run the tests invoke "mvn test" at the command line;


Assumptions

* only integer numbers;

Improvement Suggestions

* implement logging;
* IoC/Dependency injection for the implementation objects, as an example the Challenge
	implementation is coded, should be resolved in runtime context - Spring should do it;
* Also printing in the Challenge interface could be done using some kind of Strategy pattern;
