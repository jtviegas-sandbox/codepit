	~ Backup Procedure Setup ~ 
1.Files
	Along with this "README" file you should find two more
	script files named "backup.sh" and "commons.sh".
2. Dependencies
	This script "backup.sh" should run under the root account.
	You must install the dvd+rw-tools and mkisofs packages
	in order to run this script.
3. Setup
	-Copy "backup.sh" and "commons.sh" scripts into the 
	"/home/tplinux/text" folder.
	-Verify if root has run permission on both files.
	-Edit "/home/tplinux/text/backup.sh", and
	in section named "USER DEFINED VARIABLES", 
	edit the "TO_BE_BACKED_UP" and "DEVICE" variables with
	the values for your system, like:
		TO_BE_BACKED_UP="/folderX/folderW fileY folderZ"
		DEVICE="/dev/hdx"
	-Log in to the root account (~$ su - )
	-Edit the crontab ( ~# crontab -e ) and you'll be 
	presented to the vi editor:
		- press "i" and insert the following line to the list of cronjobs displayed
			0 2 * * * /home/tplinux/text/backup.sh
		- press "Escape", type ":wq" and press enter to save changes
4. Test
	For testing purposes, load a blank dvd+rw in the dvd drive,
	log in as root and run the backup script
		~# ./home/tplinux/text/backup.sh
	and in another terminal check the log with
		~# tail -f /home/tplinux/log/backup.log
	you must check the existence of the two following lines in the
	log, regardless of the date presented, if the backup process executed normally:
		<log>20080903160701 - «IN» doBackup
		<log>20080903161043 - «OUT» doBackup - (0)
