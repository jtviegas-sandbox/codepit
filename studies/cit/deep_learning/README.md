## papers

### STOCK TREND PREDICTION USING NEWS SENTIMENT ANALYSIS ( no )

* supervised machine learning as classification and other text mining techniques to check news polarity (fundamental analysis)
* uses SVM, Random Forest and Na√Øve Bayes classification algorithms for text classification
* conclusion is a bit strange, I can't see the positive relation between the classification and the stock prices

### Big Data: Deep Learning for financial sentiment analysis ( yes )

* used: Convolutional neural network (CNN), Logistic Regression, Long-Short Term Memory, Doc2Vec;
